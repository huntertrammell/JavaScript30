# JavaScript30

Captain's Log, Stardate 98931.76. I have recently decided to undertake the [#JavaScript30](https://JavaScript30.com) coding challenge. During the next 30 days I will be committing myself to spend a little more time working with JavaScript by means of building some really cool shit.

Take the challenge at [JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com), be sure to checkout more of [Wes Bos' courses](https://wesbos.com/courses) and show your support!
